# Salus

## About 
Salus is an AI-driven web app that uses a powerful AI algorithm to detect and prevent any potentially dangerous scenarios poolside by altering users through a text. Our AI can detect scenarios such as an unattended toddler or a drowning person, and quickly alert a user through text so that they can attend to the situation.

## Inspiration
We built Salus because we were alarmed and concerned about how swimming pools, something which is supposed to provide fun, can be so dangerous and harmful. Each year, thousands of kids, pets, and even adults are harmed in or drown in swimming pools due to the lack of safety measures provided. Little to no cameras or surveillance features are in place to prevent these unnecessary deaths. This is why we created Salus, as a solution to prevent any harmful scenarios or situations from occurring and allow pools to serve their purpose as a symbol of fun.

## How it was built
We built Salus through the React.js framework, the Twilio API, a TensorFlow machine learning model, and an Express.js server. React.js acted as the frontend of the web application, and we then implemented the Twilio API, which was hosted on an Express.js server. Finally, we added our Tensorflow model to the project and connected the Twilio API with the model to send texts for certain scenarios.

**unfortunately, some features such as the text message alert may not work as our Twilio free trail has expired, therefore shutting down the use of the twilio API in the project**
